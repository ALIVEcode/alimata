# Alimata

## What is it?

Alimata is a python library used to simplify the implementation of [pymata-express](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-express/) library

## Requirements

- pymata-express
- FirmataExpress

## Installing

### Pymata Express

To install Pymata Express on Linux (including Raspberry Pi) and macOS computers, open a terminal window and type: `sudo pip3 install pymata-express`

For Windows users type: `pip install pymata-express`

### Firmata Express

1. Open the Arduino IDE and select Tools/Manage Libraries
2. Search for "FirmataExpress"
3. Install
4. FirmataExpress also requires that the Ultrasonic library by Erick Sim√µes be installed.
5. Open the firmataexpress example
6. If you plan to use multiple arduino use `#define ARDUINO_INSTANCE_ID 1`
7. Flash it to the arduino

## Code structure

### Board

Creating a new board
`board = Board()`

Making the setup and loop function and starting the board

```python
    async def setup():
        #Code here is run once

    async def loop():
        #Code here is run in a loop

    #Starting the board by passing the setup and loop function
    board.start(setup,loop)

    #Shuting the board down
    board.shutdown()
```

#### All options of the board

```python
    #Create the new board (optional board_id and COM_port)
    board = Board(board_id, COM_port)

    #Starting the board setup and loop async function
    board.start(setup,loop)

    #Use to set the pin mode with the type (INPUT, OUTPUT, ANALOG, PWM, SONAR)
    board.set_pin_mode(pin, type, callback, differential, echo_pin, timeout, sensor_type, min_pulse, max_pulse)

    #Use to write to a pin with the type (ANALOG, PWM, DIGITAL, TONE, TONE_CONTINUOUS, TONE_STOP, SERVO, STEPPER)
    board.write_pin(pin, value, type, duration, step)
```

### Sensors

Creating a new sensor object (button in this case)
`button1 = Button(board, 2)`

### Actuators

Creating a new actuator object (led in this case)
`led1 = Led(board, 3)`
